## Description

This little project visualizes the curious phenominon revealed when having perfectly elastic collisions between an initially static block and a moving block of greater mass. Namely, when the latter has a mass equal to the mass of the former times some power of 100, the resulting number of times the blocks collide with each other and the times the less massive block collides with the wall is the digits of Ï€!

Grant Sanderson of 3blue1brown has a [wonderful explanation](https://youtu.be/jsYwFizhncE) of why this occurs
